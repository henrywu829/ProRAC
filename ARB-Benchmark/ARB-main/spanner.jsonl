Nut1, nut2, nut3, nut4, and nut5 are all located at the gate, but none of them are secured, with nut3 being loose. The shed is connected to location1. Spanner1, spanner3, spanner4, and spanner5 are all functional and usable. Specifically, spanner1 is at location4, spanner2 is at location7, spanner3 is at location6, spanner4 is at location1, and spanner5 is also at location1."}
