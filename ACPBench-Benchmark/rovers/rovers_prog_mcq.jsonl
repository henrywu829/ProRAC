Rovers cannot navigate to all waypoints and this makes particular routes impassable to some of the rovers. Data transmission is also constrained by the visibility of the lander from the waypoints. There are 2 rovers, 3 waypoints, 2 stores, 2 cameras, 2 objectives numbered consecutively. Further, there is 1 lander and 3 modes for the camera namely colour, high resolution, and low resolution.  Rover(s) rover0 is equipped for soil analysis. Rover(s) rover0 and rover1 are equipped for rock analysis. Rover(s) rover0 and rover1 are equipped for imaging. Rover rover1 has store store1. Rover rover0 has store store0. Rover rover1 has camera0 on board. Rover rover0 has camera1 on board. Camera camera1 can be calibrated on objective0. Camera camera0 can be calibrated on objective1. Camera camera0 supports low_res. Camera camera1 supports high_res and low_res. Rover rover1 can traverse from waypoint0 to waypoint2, waypoint2 to waypoint0, waypoint2 to waypoint1, waypoint1 to waypoint2. Rover rover0 can traverse from waypoint0 to waypoint2, waypoint2 to waypoint0, waypoint2 to waypoint1, waypoint1 to waypoint2. Waypoint(s) are visible from waypoint1: waypoint0 and waypoint2. Waypoint(s) are visible from waypoint2: waypoint1 and waypoint0. Waypoint(s) are visible from waypoint0: waypoint1 and waypoint2. Objective objective1 is visible from waypoint1. Objective objective0 is visible from waypoint0 and waypoint1. Lander general is at waypoint waypoint1.  Currently, Rover rover0 is at waypoint2. Rover rover1 is at waypoint1. Soil can be sampled at the following location(s): waypoint1. Rovers rover0 and rover1 are available. Rover rover1 has rock analyzed in waypoint waypoint1. Rover rover1 has image objective1 in mode low_res. Rover rover1 has image objective0 in mode low_res. Store(s) store0 is empty. Store(s) store1 is full.
