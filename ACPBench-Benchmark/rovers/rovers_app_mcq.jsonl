Rovers cannot navigate to all waypoints and this makes particular routes impassable to some of the rovers. Data transmission is also constrained by the visibility of the lander from the waypoints. There are 2 rovers, 7 waypoints, 2 stores, 3 cameras, 2 objectives numbered consecutively. Further, there is 1 lander and 3 modes for the camera namely colour, high resolution, and low resolution.  No rovers are equipped for soil analysis. Rover(s) rover0 and rover1 are equipped for rock analysis. Rover(s) rover0 and rover1 are equipped for imaging. Rover rover1 has store store1. Rover rover0 has store store0. Rover rover1 has camera1 and camera0 on board. Rover rover0 has camera2 on board. Camera camera0 can be calibrated on objective1. Camera camera2 can be calibrated on objective1. Camera camera1 can be calibrated on objective0. Camera camera0 supports high_res and colour and low_res. Camera camera2 supports low_res and colour. Camera camera1 supports colour. Rover rover0 can traverse from waypoint0 to waypoint5, waypoint5 to waypoint2, waypoint5 to waypoint0, waypoint1 to waypoint5, waypoint3 to waypoint0, waypoint5 to waypoint1, waypoint5 to waypoint6, waypoint5 to waypoint4, waypoint4 to waypoint5, waypoint2 to waypoint5, waypoint6 to waypoint5, waypoint0 to waypoint3.
