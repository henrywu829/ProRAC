Rover(s) rover1 and rover0 are equipped for soil analysis. Rover(s) rover1 is equipped for rock analysis. Rover(s) rover1 and rover0 are equipped for imaging. Rover rover0 has store store0. Rover rover1 has store store1. Rover rover1 has camera2 on board. Rover rover0 has camera0 and camera1 on board. Camera camera0 can be calibrated on objective1. Camera camera1 can be calibrated on objective0. Camera camera2 can be calibrated on objective0. Camera camera2 supports high_res and colour. Camera camera0 supports colour. Camera camera1 supports low_res. Rover rover0 can traverse from waypoint0 to waypoint1, waypoint0 to waypoint2, waypoint2 to waypoint0, waypoint1 to waypoint0. Rover rover1 can traverse from waypoint2 to waypoint0, waypoint1 to waypoint2, waypoint0 to waypoint2, waypoint2 to waypoint1. Waypoint(s) are visible from waypoint1: waypoint0 and waypoint2. Waypoint(s) are visible from waypoint2: waypoint0 and waypoint1. Waypoint(s) are visible from waypoint0: waypoint2 and waypoint1. Objective objective0 is visible from waypoint1 and waypoint0. Objective objective1 is visible from waypoint2. Objective objective2 is visible from waypoint1. Lander general is at waypoint waypoint1.  Currently, Rover rover0 is at waypoint0. Rover rover1 is at waypoint2. Rocks can be sampled at the following location(s): waypoint0. Soil can be sampled at the following location(s): waypoint0. Rovers rover0 and rover1 are available. Store(s) store0 and store1 are empty. The goal is to reach a state where the following facts hold: Rock data was communicated from waypoint waypoint0;, Soil data was communicated from waypoint waypoint0;, and Image objective1 was communicated in mode colour.", "question": "Given the plan: \"move the rover rover1 from waypoint waypoint2 to waypoint waypoint0, calibrate the camera camera2 on the rover rover1 for the objective objective0 at the waypoint waypoint0, use the rover rover0 to collect soil samples at waypoint waypoint0 and store them in the store store0, communicate the soil data from the rover rover0 at waypoint waypoint0 with the soil analysis of waypoint waypoint0 to the lander general at waypoint waypoint1, sample rock at waypoint waypoint0 with rover rover1 and store in store store1, communicate rock data from rover rover1 at waypoint waypoint0 about waypoint waypoint0 to lander general at waypoint waypoint1, move the rover rover1 from waypoint waypoint0 to waypoint waypoint2, take an image of objective objective1 in mode colour using camera camera2 on rover rover1 from waypoint waypoint2, transmit the image data of the objective objective1 in mode colour from the rover rover1 at waypoint waypoint2 to the lander general at waypoint waypoint1, if storey is full, drop store store0 of rover rover0, move the rover rover1 from waypoint waypoint2 to waypoint waypoint0\"; which of the following actions can be removed from this plan and still have a valid plan?
