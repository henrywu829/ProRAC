Rovers cannot navigate to all waypoints and this makes particular routes impassable to some of the rovers. Data transmission is also constrained by the visibility of the lander from the waypoints. There are 2 rovers, 3 waypoints, 2 stores, 2 cameras, 2 objectives numbered consecutively. Further, there is 1 lander and 3 modes for the camera namely colour, high resolution, and low resolution.
