However, robots can only paint the tile that is in front (up) and behind (down) them, and once a tile has been painted no robot can stand on it. Robots need to paint a grid with black and white, where the cell color is alternated always. There are 9 tiles and 2 robots. The tiles locations are: tile_6 is to the right of tile_5, tile_2 is to the right of tile_1, tile_9 is to the right of tile_8, tile_8 is to the right of tile_7, tile_3 is to the right of tile_2, and tile_5 is to the right of tile_4. Further, tile_3 is down from tile_6, tile_6 is down from tile_9, tile_4 is down from tile_7, tile_1 is down from tile_4, tile_5 is down from tile_8, and tile_2 is down from tile_5 Currently, robot robot2 is at tile_8 and holding color black and robot robot1 is at tile_6 and holding color white; tile_1, tile_7, tile_3, tile_4, tile_5, tile_9, and tile_2 are clear. The goal is to reach a state where the following facts hold: Tile tile_7 is painted in black color, Tile tile_6 is painted in white color, Tile tile_9 is painted in black color, Tile tile_4 is painted in white color, Tile tile_5 is painted in black color, and Tile tile_8 is painted in white color.", "question": "Which of the following claims is true with regard to the following sequence of actions \"move robot robot2 from tile tile_8 to the left tile tile tile_7, move robot robot2 down from tile tile_7 to tile tile_4, use robot robot2 to paint the tile tile_7 above the tile tile_4 with the color black, alter the color of the robot robot2 from color black to color white, move robot robot1 from tile tile_6 to the left tile tile tile_5, use robot robot1 to paint the tile tile_8 above the tile tile_5 with the color white, alter the color of the robot robot1 from color white to color black, navigate robot robot1 from tile tile_5 to tile tile_6 to the right, use robot robot1 to paint the tile tile_9 above the tile tile_6 with the color black, alter the color of the robot robot2 from color white to color white, paint the tile tile_3 down from tile tile_6 with color black using the robot robot1, alter the color of the robot robot1 from color black to color black, alter the color of the robot robot1 from color black to color black, paint the tile tile_1 down from tile tile_4 with color white using the robot robot2, alter the color of the robot robot1 from color black to color white, alter the color of the robot robot1 from color white to color black, alter the color of the robot robot1 from color black to color white\"  A.
