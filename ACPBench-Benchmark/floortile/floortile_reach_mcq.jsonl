Further, tile_2 is down from tile_8, tile_15 is down from tile_21, tile_10 is down from tile_16, tile_13 is down from tile_19, tile_17 is down from tile_23, tile_1 is down from tile_7, tile_18 is down from tile_24, tile_12 is down from tile_18, tile_3 is down from tile_9, tile_7 is down from tile_13, tile_4 is down from tile_10, tile_6 is down from tile_12, tile_8 is down from tile_14, tile_9 is down from tile_15, tile_14 is down from tile_20, tile_16 is down from tile_22, tile_5 is down from tile_11, and tile_11 is down from tile_17 Currently, robot robot1 is at tile_5 and holding color white and robot robot2 is at tile_1 and holding color black; tile_13, tile_16, tile_4, tile_2, tile_10, tile_6, tile_7, tile_9, and tile_3 are clear; tile_19 is painted white, tile_24 is painted black, tile_15 is painted black, tile_11 is painted white, tile_8 is painted black, tile_14 is painted white, tile_22 is painted black, tile_18 is painted white, tile_12 is painted black, tile_17 is painted black, tile_20 is painted black, tile_21 is painted white, and tile_23 is painted white.", "question": "Which of the following options can hold in a state that can potentially be reached? A. Robot robot2 is at tile_6 location and tile_6 is clear. B. Tile tile_8 is painted in black color and Tile tile_8 is painted in white color. C. Robot robot2 is at tile_6 location and Robot robot1 is at tile_6 location. D. Tile tile_7 is painted in black color.", "choices": {"label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"], "text": ["Robot robot2 is at tile_6 location and tile_6 is clear", "Tile tile_8 is painted in black color and Tile tile_8 is painted in white color", "Robot robot2 is at tile_6 location and Robot robot1 is at tile_6 location", "Tile tile_7 is painted in black color"]}, "query": "Which fact is reachable from this state?", "answer": "D"}
