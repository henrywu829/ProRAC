Further, tile_7 is down from tile_12, tile_6 is down from tile_11, tile_10 is down from tile_15, tile_5 is down from tile_10, tile_4 is down from tile_9, tile_12 is down from tile_17, tile_1 is down from tile_6, tile_11 is down from tile_16, tile_14 is down from tile_19, tile_9 is down from tile_14, tile_8 is down from tile_13, tile_13 is down from tile_18, tile_15 is down from tile_20, tile_3 is down from tile_8, and tile_2 is down from tile_7 Currently, robot robot2 is at tile_3 and holding color black and robot robot1 is at tile_2 and holding color black; tile_5, tile_1, and tile_4 are clear; tile_8 is painted white, tile_16 is painted white, tile_13 is painted black, tile_7 is painted black, tile_15 is painted black, tile_18 is painted white, tile_20 is painted white, tile_11 is painted black, tile_6 is painted white, tile_17 is painted black, tile_19 is painted black, tile_10 is painted white, tile_12 is painted white, tile_14 is painted white, and tile_9 is painted black.", "question": "Which of the following facts hold after performing the action \"navigate robot robot1 from tile tile_2 to tile tile_1 to its left\" in the current state? A. Tile tile_10 is painted in white color. B. Robot robot1 is at tile_2 location and tile_9 is clear. C. tile_2 is clear and Robot robot1 is at tile_2 location. D.
